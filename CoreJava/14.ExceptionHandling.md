**Exception Handling** is a core part of writing robust and production-grade Java applications. It's how Java lets you deal with unexpected events like network failures, file-not-found errors, or division-by-zero ‚Äî without crashing the program.

# üí• Java Core Concept: Exception Handling

---

## üöß What is an Exception?

An **exception** is an **event that disrupts the normal flow** of a program. It typically occurs when something goes wrong during execution, like:

- Dividing by zero
- Accessing an invalid index
- Opening a missing file

In Java, **exceptions are objects** that can be caught and handled using the exception handling mechanism.

## üìä Java Exception Hierarchy

```plaintext
Object
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Throwable
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Error         (Serious problems: OutOfMemoryError)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Exception     (Things we can handle)
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RuntimeException (Unchecked)
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other Exceptions (Checked)
```

## üìÇ Types of Exceptions

| Type             | Examples                          | Need to Handle? |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Checked**      | FileNotFoundException, IOException| YES (must catch or declare) |
| **Unchecked**    | NullPointerException, ArithmeticException | NO (optional to catch) |
| **Error**        | OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError | NO (fatal, shouldn't handle) |

---

## üß∞ Java Exception Handling Keywords

| Keyword   | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `try`     | Wrap code that might throw an exception |
| `catch`   | Handle specific exception |
| `finally` | Always executes (used for cleanup) |
| `throw`   | Manually throw an exception |
| `throws`  | Declare method may throw an exception |

---

## üß™ Basic Try-Catch Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero: " + e);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üîÅ `finally` Block ‚Äî Always Runs

```java
try {
    int data = 10 / 2;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup code in finally block");
}
```

Even if an exception occurs or not ‚Äî `finally` will run.

---

## üöÄ `throw` and `throws`

### `throw`: Used to throw an exception manually.

```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument");
```

### `throws`: Declares an exception may occur.

```java
void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("file.txt");
}
```

---

## üí° Custom Exception Class

You can define your own exception by extending `Exception` or `RuntimeException`.

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}

class Test {
    void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) throw new InvalidAgeException("Not eligible to vote");
    }
}
```

---

## üß© Why Use It?

Exception handling embodies **OOP design**:

- Promotes **separation of concerns** (normal logic vs error handling)
- Encourages **clean, readable code**
- Implements **polymorphism** (catch different exceptions via inheritance)
- Supports **custom behavior** via user-defined exceptions

Without exception handling, you'd be left with scattered `if/else` blocks and hard-to-maintain code.

---

## üõ° Best Practices

- Catch **specific exceptions** first, then general ones.
- Use `finally` for **resource cleanup** (e.g., closing files, DB connections).
- Don't suppress exceptions silently (`catch (Exception e) {}`).
- Avoid catching `Throwable` unless you're writing a framework.

---

## üè† Homework for Students

### üìå Tasks:

1. Write a method `divide(int a, int b)` that:
   - Throws `ArithmeticException` if `b == 0`
   - Uses `try-catch` to handle it and return safe result

2. Create a method `readFile(String path)` that:
   - Throws `FileNotFoundException`
   - Declare it using `throws`
   - Handle it in the calling method

3. Create a custom exception `InvalidScoreException`
   - If score < 0 or > 100, throw this exception
   - Test it in a grading system

4. Demonstrate `finally` block with a simple division operation
