# 📘 Java Core Concept: Packages

### 🧠 What Are Packages in Java?

A **package** in Java is like a folder in your system that groups related classes and interfaces together. It helps organize code, avoid class name conflicts, and control access levels.

Think of it like arranging your Java files in folders, so things don’t get messy as your project grows.

### 🔍 Why Use Packages?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Modularity** | Related classes stay together logically and physically. |
| ✅ **Avoid Naming Conflicts** | Two classes with the same name can live in different packages. |
| ✅ **Access Control** | You can use `protected` and `default` (package-private) visibility. |
| ✅ **Reusable Code** | Easily reuse utility or domain packages across projects. |

### 🔧 Types of Packages

1. **Built-in Packages**: Provided by the Java SDK.
   - Examples: `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.lang`, etc.
2. **User-defined Packages**: You create your own to organize your codebase.

---

### 🧱 Example: Creating and Using a Package

#### Step 1: Create a User-Defined Package

📄 **File: `mypackage/MessagePrinter.java`**
```java
package mypackage;

public class MessagePrinter {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the package!");
    }
}
```

> 🔸 `package mypackage;` must be the first line in the file.

---

#### Step 2: Use the Package in Another File

📄 **File: `Main.java`**
```java
import mypackage.MessagePrinter;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MessagePrinter printer = new MessagePrinter();
        printer.print();
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Compile & Run:

From the directory **above** `mypackage`, run:
```bash
javac mypackage/MessagePrinter.java
javac Main.java
java Main
```

### 🔐 Package and Access Modifiers

- **Default (no modifier)**: Class is accessible only within its own package.
- **`protected`**: Accessible in the same package and in subclasses even if they're in different packages.
- **`public`**: Accessible from everywhere.
- **`private`**: Still only within the same class, unaffected by packages.

This makes packages **essential** for implementing Java’s access control and encapsulation mechanisms.

---

### ⚖️ Best Practices

- Use meaningful package names, often based on reverse domain structure (e.g., `com.myapp.services`).
- Group related classes (e.g., controllers, models, services, utils).
- Avoid mixing unrelated classes in one package.
- Use access modifiers effectively to protect internals of your package.

### 🏠 Homework for Students

1. Create a package named `university` containing the following classes:
   - `Student` with `name`, `rollNumber` and a method `displayDetails()`.
   - `Teacher` with `name`, `subject` and a method `displayDetails()`.

2. In a separate file (outside the package), import both classes and:
   - Create objects for each.
   - Call their `displayDetails()` method.

3. Try to:
   - Access a class with **default** visibility from another package.
   - Use `protected` and `public` modifiers and observe access behavior.
